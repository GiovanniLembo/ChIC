\description{
QC-metrics of newly analysed ChIP-seq samples can be compared with the reference values of the compendium and enrichment profiles can be 
plotted against pre-computed profiles of published datasets.  
The metagene profiles show the problematic samples signal (red line) for the ChIP, for the input and their relative enrichment when compared to the 
compendiumâ€™s mean signal (black line) and its 2 x standard error (blue shadow). Additionally the function plots the desired QC-metric
as a red dashed line for the sample plotted against the reference distribution (density plots) of the compendium values stratified by chromatin marks.
